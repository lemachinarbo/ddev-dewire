# Patterns in this file follow rsync's matching rules:
# - Patterns are relative to the project root (the directory you run rsync from).
# - A pattern starting with '/' is anchored to the project root (e.g. '/vendor' matches only the root-level vendor).
# - A pattern without '/' matches any directory or file with that name at any depth (e.g. 'vendor' matches vendor anywhere).
# - A pattern ending with '/' matches directories only.
